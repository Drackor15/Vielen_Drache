	## Build Dev Scene ##
		|
	   (MAIN QUESTS)
		|
		'-> Scene
		|	|
		|	'-> Basic plain area for a player to test movement in. Doesn't need any fancy bells or whistles right now.
		|		|
		|		'-> For a main goal, try to get a foundation to stand on, and walls on either side to begin with.
		|
		'-> Player
		|	|
		|	'-> Cube or static image that when WASD(arrow if you want too) keys are pressed, the player can walk left and right. Tile size of 1x1.
		|		|
		|		'-> Try to add a jump function. If not that, possibly the ability to move up and down without gravity (down would probably be temporary).
		|
		'-> Enemy
		|	|
		|	'-> Cube or static image that when landed on / a player collides with on the top side, the enemy dies / disappears. Tile size of 1x1
		|	|
		|	'-> When the player collides with the left, right, or bottom side, kill the player.
		|
	   (SIDE QUESTS) <------- (NOT NEEDED QUITE YET, DON'T STRESS ABOUT THESE!)
		|
		'-> Scene
		|	|
		|	'-> If you are up for up too, try a platform that a player can jump through on the bottom, but cannot fall through from the top.
		|	|
		|	'-> Another thing if you want to attempt it, try a bottomless pit/gap in the foundation that kills the player if they fall in.
		|
		'-> Player
		|	|
		|	'-> Implement gravity for jumping so that the player doesn't continually fly up.
		|		|
		|		'-> Also so the player doesn't have omnidirectional flight in a platformer, that removes the challenge.
		|
		'-> Enemy
		|	|
		|	'-> Have the enemy patrol / walking back and forth or around. We're basically imitating the classic Goomba interaction from Mario.
		|	|
		|	'-> Make a different enemy, and give them a new quirk. I recommend even keeping it as simple as of a moveset/behavior addition as possible.
		|	'-> EXAMPLES:
		|		|
		|		'-> Give them a method to attack back.
		|		|
		|		'-> Make them randomly jump.
		|		|
		|		'-> Make them a different tile size than 1x1, like 2x2, 3x1, 1x3, etc.
		|		|
		|		'-> Make them move faster or slower than others.
		|		|				
		|		'-> Make them follow/pursue the player.
		|
		|
		'-> Tiles
			|
			'-> (AMANDA/EVERYONE) Try making some "Test Tiles" (16x16 or 32x32 for a resolution).
			|
			'-> (EVERYONE) Ideally, try to make a whole theme of something you think looks good!

	## Grid ##
		|
		|
		|
		(CORE GAME OBJECT ZONES/LAYERS)
		|	|
		|	'-> Play Area Layer
		|	|	|
		|	|	'-> Terrain, Player, Enemies, Collectibles, Powerups, Projectiles, ETC.
		|	|
		|	'-> Background
		|		|
		|		'-> Distant image behind everything.
		|			|
		|			'-> PARALLAX: image scrolls slower in the background for an illusion of depth (slower = feels further away).
		|
		(EXTENSION GAME OBJECT ZONES/LAYERS)
			|
			'-> Foreground
			|	|
			|	'-> Designs/images that obscure everything else (Play Area, Wall, and Background layers).
			|
			'-> Wall
			      |
			      '->  A layer right behind the terrain, a sort of close background to help convey partial interiors (think Terraria walls).
